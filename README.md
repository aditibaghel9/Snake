# Snake

This is a very simple Snake game.

Shape classes in the `SwingShapes` package came from here: [https://github.com/SER120L/SwingShapes](https://github.com/SER120L/SwingShapes).

Instructions to play:

The snake will spawn in a random spot. Collect the pellets to extend the Snake, one pellet at a time. 

If the snake hits its own tail or the wall, you will lose and the game window will exit.

The snake's head is a darker shade of blue compared to its body and tail.

Have fun!
